# wine-classifier

Can an engineer without oenology studies classify wines?

For the final practical work of the Machine Learning Course with Python dictated by the UTN, I developed a pipeline using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB). The code allows to classify wines according to multiple features, such as alcohol, malic acid, color intensity and magnesium. The dataset was imported from sklearn and in the notebook I compared the results between scaling and not scaling the input data. The work shows the importance of feature scaling when using PCA. 

Note: the comments in the notebook are written in Spanish.
